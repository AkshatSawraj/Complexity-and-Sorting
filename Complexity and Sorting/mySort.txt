Sort of Choice : Heap Sort

Time complexity : O(n log n)

What it does:

For this explanation I will assume you understand the rules of a heap.

The Heap sort grabs the larget possible number in a heap and places
it in the last possible position in an array.

Then it takes whatever number was in its position and swaps it 
whatever position the larger number came from as well as locking the 
largest number away knowing it does not need to be touched again.

After that, it takes the remaining numbers and rearanges them if needed 
such that the rules of a heap are not broken.(Puts the number further down 
swapping with each position it is moved so long as the are larger of
the two numbers is not on top).

This proccess is then repeated until all the numbers 
are locked away in an array in a sorted order.
